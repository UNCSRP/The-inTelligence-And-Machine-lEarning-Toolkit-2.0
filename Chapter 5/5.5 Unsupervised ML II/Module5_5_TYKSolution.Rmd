library(FactoMineR)
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
library(reshape2)

```

## TYK Question 1

Determine the optimal number of *k*-means clusters of cytokines derived from the nasal epithelieum lining fluid of e-cigarette users.

Starting by performing the necessary data manipulation.
```{r}
# selecting NELF samples from ecig users
ecig_df = cytokines_df %>%
    filter(Group == "Ecig", Compartment == "NELF") 

head(ecig_df)
```

```{r}
wider_ecig_df = reshape2::dcast(ecig_df, Protein ~ SubjectID, value.var = "Conc_pslog2") %>% 
  column_to_rownames("Protein")

head(wider_ecig_df)
```


Finding the "best" number of clusters to use. 
```{r fig.align = 'center'}
# Elbow method
fviz_nbclust(wider_ecig_df, kmeans, method = "wss") +
  labs(subtitle = "Elbow method") 

# Silhouette method
fviz_nbclust(wider_ecig_df, kmeans, method = "silhouette") + 
  labs(subtitle = "Silhouette method") 

# Gap statistic method
fviz_nbclust(wider_ecig_df, kmeans, method = "gap_stat") + 
  labs(subtitle = "Gap Statisitc method") 
```

The elbow method is suggesting 3 clusters, the silhouette method is suggesting 2, and the gap statistic method suggests 1. Since each of these methods is recommending different *k* values, we can go ahead and run *k*-means to visualize the clusters and test those different *k*'s. 
```{r fig.align = 'center'}
# Choosing to iterate through 2 or 3 clusters using i as our iterator
for (i in 2:3){
    # nstart = number of random starting partitions, it's recommended for nstart > 1
    cluster_k <- kmeans(wider_ecig_df, centers = i, nstart = 25)
    cluster_plot <- fviz_cluster(cluster_k, data = wider_ecig_df) + ggtitle(paste0("k = ", i))
    print(cluster_plot)
}
```

**Answer**: 2 or 3 clusters could be justified here, but we'll move forward with 3 clusters to more easily compare to the non-smoker clusters.

## TYK Question 2 

How do those clusters compare to the ones that were derived at baseline (in non-smokers)?

This question can be answer by obtaining the cluster assignments.
```{r}
# getting cluster assignments
cluster_kmeans_3 <- kmeans(wider_ecig_df, centers = 3, nstart = 25)
cluster_kmeans_df <- data.frame(cluster_kmeans_3$cluster) %>%
    rownames_to_column("Cytokine") %>%
    rename(`K-Means Cluster` = cluster_kmeans_3.cluster) %>%
    # Ordering the dataframe for easier comparison
    arrange(`K-Means Cluster`)

cluster_kmeans_df
```

**Answer**: All cytokines clustered together as they did in non-smoking subjects with the exception IL-6, which moved from cluster 1 to cluster 2.

## TYK Question 3

Which cytokines have the greatest contributions to the first two eigenvectors?
```{r fig.align = 'center'}
# First running PCA
pca_cytokine <- prcomp(wider_ecig_df, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)

# kmeans contributions
fviz_contrib(pca_cytokine, 
             choice = "ind", 
             axes = 1:2) # specifies to show contribution percentages for first 2 PCs
```

**Answer**: The cytokines that have the greatest contributions to the first two principal components include IL-8, Fractalkine, IP-10, IL-4, MIG, I309, IL-12p70, and IL-10.
