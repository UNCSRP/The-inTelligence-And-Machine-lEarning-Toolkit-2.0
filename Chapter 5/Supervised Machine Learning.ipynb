    "## Introduction to Machine Learning, including Supervised Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine learning is a field that has been around for decades, but has exploded in popularity and utility in recent years due to proliferation of big data. Through the building of models, machine learning has the ability to sift through and learn from large volumes of data and use that knowledge to solve problems. The challenges of big and high dimensional data as they pertain to environmental health and how machine learning can mitigate some of those challenges are discussed further in [Payton et. al](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ftox.2023.1171175/full).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "Within the field of machine learning, there are many different types of machine learning that can be run to address environmental health research questions. The two most commonly used categories used in environmental health research are: (1) supervised machine learning and (2) unsupervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised machine learning** involves training a model using a labeled dataset, where each dependent or predictor variable is associated with an independent variable with a known outcome. This allows the model to learn how to predict the labeled outcome on data it hasn't \"seen\" before based on the patterns and relationships it previously identified in the data. For example, supervised machine learning has been used for cancer prediction and prognosis based on variables like tumor size, stage, and age ([Lynch et. al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386505617302368?via%3Dihub), [Asadi et. al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7416093/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised machine learning includes: \n",
    "+ Classification: Using algorithms to classify a categorical outcome (ie. plant species, disease status, etc.)\n",
    "+ Regression: Using algorithms to predict a continuous outcome (ie. temperature, chemical concentration, etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised machine learning**, on the other hand, involves using models to find patterns or associations between variables in dataset that lack a known or labeled outcome. For example, unsupervised machine learning has been used to find associations of co-expressed genes within various biological pathways ([Bot√≠a et. al](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0420-6), [Pagnuco et. al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754317300575?via%3Dihub)).\n",

    "Overall, the distinction between supervised and unsupervised learning is an important concept in machine learning, as it can inform the choice of algorithms and techniques used to analyze and make predictions from data. It is worth noting that there are also other types of machine learning, such as semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning and deep learning."

    "## Training Supervised Machine Learning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised machine learning, algorithms need to be trained before they can be used to predict data. This involves selecting a smaller portion of data, known as training data, so that the model will learn how to predict the outcome as accurately as possible. The process of training an algorithm is essential for enabling it to learn and improve over time, allowing it to make more accurate predictions and better adapt to new and changing circumstances. Ultimately, the effectiveness of a machine learning model depends on the quality and relevance of its training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine you're interested in predicting an animal's species (either a cat or a dog) based on a dataset that contains variables regarding weight, height, coat color, ear shape, etc. These data can be divided into a training set and a test set. The **training set** is a subset of the data that the model will learn from to make associations between the predictor variables (ie. height, weight etc.) and the outcome (ie. cat or dog). The **test set** is used used to evaluate what the model has learned from the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to split the entire dataset into the training set that contains 60% of the data and the test set that contains 40% of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/UNC-CEMALB/P1006_Data-Organization-for-High-Dimensional-Analyses-in-Environmental-Health/assets/69641855/a8c723ec-e50c-4cb9-aff5-4230d0d6fc2c\" width=\"684\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Created with BioRender.com*\n",
    "\n",
    "Other common splits include 70% training / 30% test and 80% training / 20% test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of developing a model often involves dividing the data into three main sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Set:** a subset of the data that the model uses to learn from the data by identifying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validation Set**: a subset of training set data that is used to evaluate the model's fit in an unbiased way by fine-tuning its parameters and optimizing its performance. This is akin to pop quizzes that help students improve their understanding and performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Set:** a subset of data that is used to evaluate the final model's fit based on the training and validation sets. This is akin to the model's final exam, as it provides an objective assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the test set should only be used once, after the model has been trained using the training dataset. Using the test set multiple times during the development process can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the test data but poorly on new, unseen data. The ideal algorithm is generalizable or flexible enough to accurately predict unseen data. This is known as the bias-variance tradeoff. For further information on the bias-variance tradeoff, see [Understanding the Bias-Variance Tradeoff](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-bias-variance-tradeoff-165e6942b229).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "The last topic we should mention in this section is **cross validation** or ***k*-fold cross validation**. If the dataset is based on this 60:40 split that we mentioned earlier, our model's accuracy will likely be influenced based upon *where* this 60:40 split occurs in the dataset. This will likely bias the data and reduce the algorithm's ability to predict accurately. Cross validation (CV) is implemented to fine tune a model's parameters and ensure that the model is exposed to more patterns in the dataset, which reduces bias and improves prediction accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "It works by equally splitting the samples in the dataset into *k* number of folds or groups. For example, if 5-fold CV were to be run, we would have 5 different groups in the dataset with 4 retained for validation sets to train the model and 1 retained for testing to fine tune the model's parameters. Across the five iterations, each fold would have a chance to be the test set as seen in the figure below. To measure prediction in Random Forest, out of bag (OOB) errors are calculated each time when tuning parameters. The lower the OOB error, the better the model performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Assessing Model Performance  \n",
    "Metrics from a confusion matrix are used to measure model performance for classification-based supervised machine learning models. A confusion matrix consists of table that displays the numbers of how often the algorithm correctly or incorrectly predicted the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to our animal classification example, let's say the confusion matrix below is a result of how well the model was able to predict whether an animal was considered to be a cat or a dog.\n",

    "*Created with BioRender.com*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the metrics that can be obtained from a confusion matrix are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Balanced Accuracy:** is the ratio of correct predictions (TP + TN) to the total number of predictions (TP + TN + TN + FN) and is typically used to assess overall model performance. This metric is prone to skew for imbalanced data. For example, if the animal dataset had 11 cats and 74 dogs the data would be considered to be imbalanced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Sensitivity or Recall:** evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"positive\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true positives to total number of all true positives (TP + FN). \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Specificity:** evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"negative\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true negatives to total number of all true negatives (TN + FP). \n",
    "\n",
    "+  **Positive Predictive Value (PPV) or Precision:**  evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"positive\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true positives to total number of predicted positives (TP + FP).\n",
    "\n",
    "+  **Negative Predictive Value (NPV):**  evaluates how well the model was able to predict the \"negative\" class. It's the ratio of correctly classified true negatives to total number of predicted positives (TN + FN).\n",
    "\n",
    "For all metrics, the values fall between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates the model was not able to classify any data points correctly and 1 indicating that the model was able to classify all test data correctly. Although subjective, a balanced accuracy of at least 0.7 is considered respectable ([Barkved, 2022](https://www.obviously.ai/post/machine-learning-model-performance#:~:text=Good%20accuracy%20in%20machine%20learning,also%20consistent%20with%20industry%20standards.)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For multi-class classification (more than two labeled outcomes to be predicted), the same metrics are used, but are obtained in a slightly different way. Regression based supervised machine learning models use loss functions to evaluate model performance.

    "In conclusion, this training module has provided an informative introduction to supervised machine learning using classification techniques in R. Machine learning is a powerful tool that can help researchers gain new insights and improve models to analyze complex datasets faster and in a more comprehensive way. The example we've explored demonstrates the utility of supervised machine learning models on datasets with a plethora of features.\n",
