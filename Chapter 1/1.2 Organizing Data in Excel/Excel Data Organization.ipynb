    "# Data Organization in Excel\n",
    "\n",
    "This training module was developed by Alexis Payton and Dr. Julia E. Rager\n",
    "\n",
    "Spring 2023\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Training Module\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is intended to be a guide to clean and organize data in Excel:\n",
    " - To make running analyses easier in R. \n",
    " - To ensure that the data is clear and easily interpretable by all collaborators, reviewers, and readers. \n",
    "    \n",
    "In this training tutorial, we'll make use of an example dataset that needs to be cleaned. The dataset contains mediator concentrations (sterols and cytokines) derived from human serum samples along with demographic information for each subject. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are by no means exhaustive! Rather use this dataset as an example of a way to clean the data. Datasets often come in many different formats from our wet bench colleagues, therefore some steps might need to be added, removed, or amended.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Save a copy of the new organized and cleaned dataset\n",
    "> Open Excel and prior to **ANY** edits, click “File” --> “Save As” to save a new version of the file that serve as the cleaned version of the data.\n",
    "   > - This is very important in the instance that the original version needs to be referred back to (ie. if data is accidently deleted). \n",
    "> The file needs to be named something indicative of the data it contains followed by the current date (ie. \"Allostatic Mediator Data_061622\"). \n",
    "    - The title should be succinct and descriptive. \n",
    "    - It's okay to use dashes or underscores in the name of the title, but stay away from special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture1.png\"  />\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Remove extraneous white space\n",
    "> Remove the entirely blank rows of cells\n",
    "  >  - Excel Trick: Select all lines that need to be removed and press Ctrl + - (minus key) for Mac users. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture2.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replace missing data with “NA”\n",
    "> There was no missing data in this dataset, so this step can be skipped. This is done to confirm that the data is indeed missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a metadata tab\n",
    "> Metadata explains what each column represents in the dataset. Move this tab  to the first tab and entitle it “XXXXX_METADATA” (ie. “Allostatic_METADATA\"). Relabel the data tab as “XXXX_DATA” (ie. “Allostatic_DATA). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture3.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abbreviate and capitalize categorical data\n",
    "> This helps reducing typing and potential typing mistakes in R. Once the categorical data has been abbreviated, add those abbreviations to the metadata and describe what they symbolize. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture4.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alphabetize (sort) the data by the categorical variable of interest \n",
    "> For this dataset, we will sort by the column \"Group\". This organizes the data and sets it up for the next step.\n",
    "    > - Click on the cell that contains the column name \"Group\". \n",
    "    > - Click the \"Sort & Filter\" button, click \"Filter\", and then click \"Ascending\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a new subject number column\n",
    "> Relabel the subject number/identifier column as “Original_Subject_Number” and create an ordinal subject number column labeled “Subject_Number”. \n",
    "   > - \tR reads in spaces between words as periods, therefore it’s common practice to replace spaces with underscores when doing data analysis in R. \n",
    "   > - Avoid using dashes in column names or anywhere else in the dataset. \n",
    "    \n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture5.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remove special symbols and dashes\n",
    "> This dataset contains dashes and Greek letters, remove those dashes and replace the Greek letters with first letter of the word in English (ie. TNF-$\\alpha$ becomes TNFa). \n",
    "   \n",
    "### Bold all column names and center all data. \n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture6.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a subject identifier column\n",
    "> The subject identifer column labeled, “Subject_ID”, combines the subject number with the variable of interest (ie. Group for this dataset). \n",
    "  > - This is useful for analyses to identify outliers by the subject number and the group. \n",
    "  \n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture7.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "13.\tCreate separate files for the experimental data and demographics data (ie. sex, race, age).\n",
    "14.\tThe demographics dataset should be entitled “XXX_Subject_Info_061622” (ie. “Allostatic_Subject_Info_061622”). \n",
    "    - This wasn’t done for this dataset, since it had a smaller size and the analyses were simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Convert the data from a wide to long format \n",
    "> A wide format contains values that **DO NOT** repeat the subject identifier column. For this dataset, each subject has one row containing all of its data, therefore the subject identifier occurs once in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wide Format**\n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture8.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "> A long format contains values that **DO** repeat the subject identifier column. For this dataset, that means a new column was created entitled \"Variable\" containing all the mediator names and a column entitled \"Value\" containing all their corresponding values. In the screenshot, an additional column, \"Category\", was added to help with the categorization of mediators in R analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Format**\n",
    "<img src=\"Screenshots/Picture9.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "> The reason a long format is preferred is because it makes visualizations and statistical analyses more efficient in R. In the long format, we were able to add a column to categorize the mediators into \"AL Biomarker\" or \"Cytokine\" allowing us to more easily subset the mediators in R. \n",
    "\n",
    "> To convert the data from a wide to long format, follow the steps below:\n",
