# File Management for Github

## Introduction to Training Module

Overall, file management and good data practices are imperative, especially when working in shared project folders. Often, analyses and manuscripts are amended a plethora of times prior to being submitted for a grant or publication, therefore the following steps are used to track how and when a file is modified over time in Github. 

Github is an open source or publicly accessible platform designed to facilitate version control and issue tracking of code.  It is used by us and many of our colleagues to not only document versions of script written for data analysis and visualization, but to also make our code publicly available for manuscript submission. 

### Creating an Account
> Head to [github.com](github.com), click "Sign Up" and follow the on screen instructions.

### Creating a Repository
A repository, also known as a "repo", is similar to a project folder that will contain all code pertaining to a specific project, grant or manuscript. It can be public or private and multiple people can work on a project together in a single repository. 
> Click the circle in top right-hand corner and click "Your repositories".

> Click on the green button that says "New".

> Give your repository a generic descriptive name or name it the same title as your manuscript and click "Add a README file".

For more information visit Github's [Create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) documentation.

### Uploading Code
> To uploade code, navigate to the repository you have access to or the repository you just created.   

<img src="Screenshots/Picture1.png"  />

> Click “Add file” then click “upload files”. Drag and drop your file containing your script into github and click “commit changes”. 

*Note that there are other ways to upload your code, but this is the easiest way.* 

> To keep the repository organized, it might be necessary to create a new folder (like the folder labeled “1.Summary Statistics” in the above screenshot). Files can be grouped into these folders based on the type of analysis. 

> To do so, click on the new file and then click on the pencil icon next to the "Blame" button. 

<img src="Screenshots/Picture2.png"  />

> Click on the box that contains the title of the file. Write the title of your new folder and then end with a forward slash (/). In the screenshot below, we're creating a new folder entitled "New Folder". Click “commit changes” and your file should now be in a new folder.

### Updating Code
> Saving iterations of code can save valuable time later as analyses are ever changing. If your code undergoes substantial changes, (ie. adding/ removing steps or if there’s code that is likely to be beneficial later on, but is no longer relevant to the current analysis), it is advised to save that version. 

> To do so, create a subfolder named “Archive” and move the old file into it. If you have multiple versions of a file with the same name, add the current date to prevent the file from being overwritten later on as seen in the screenshot below. 

<img src="Screenshots/Picture4.png"  />

> Once the old file version has been archived, now upload the most recent version of your code to the main  folder. Based on the screenshot above, that would be under “3. ML Visualizations”. 


*Note: If a file is uploaded with the same name it will be overwritten, which can't be undone! Therefore, put the older file into the archive folder if you'd like it to be saved **PRIOR** to uploading the new version.*

### Paralleling the Repository with a Manuscript
> If the code is for a manuscript, include the table or figure name it pertains to in the manuscript in paratheses. For example, "Baseline Clusters (Figure 3)". This allows for viewers to find each table or figure faster.

### Using a README.md file 
> A README.md file is used to describe the overall aims and purpose of the analyses in the repository or a folder within a repository. It is often the first file that someone will look at in a repo/folder, so it is important to include information that would be valuable to an outsider trying to make use of the work.

> To add a README.md file, click “add file” and then “create new file”. 
 
<img src="Screenshots/Picture6.png"  />

> Name your file “README.md”.

> A “README.md” file uses R markdown syntax. Familiarize yourself with R markdown syntax [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) and [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html).

> The final README.md file for the **OVERALL** repository should look something like the screenshot below. Always include…
> -	The main goal of the project 
> -	NB Viewer link
>    +	Sometimes the files take too long to render, so link the repository from the NB viewer website.
>    +	Go to [nbviewer.org](nbviewer.org) --> type in the name of the repository --> copy the url and add it to the README.md file
> -	The final manuscript name, year it was published, Pub Med ID (if applicable)
> -	Graphical abstract (if needed for publication)

> The final README.md file for the **PROJECT** repository should look something like the screenshot below. Always include…
> -	The name of each file
> -	Brief description of each file
> - Table or Figure name in the corresponding manuscript (if applicable)

### Example Repositories
Below are links to repositories that contain script for analyses used in published manuscripts. These are examples of well organized Github repositories.
