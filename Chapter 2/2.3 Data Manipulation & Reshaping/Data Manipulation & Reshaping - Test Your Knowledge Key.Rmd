```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Loading data
demographic_data <- read.csv("Module2_3/Module2_3_DemographicData.csv")
chemical_data <- read.csv("Module2_3/Module2_3_ChemicalData.csv")
```


```{r}
# Viewing data
head(demographic_data)
head(chemical_data)
```

```{r}
# Merging to create one dataframe and also removing columns that aren't needed for this analysis
chemical_demographic_df = inner_join(demographic_data[,c(1,6)], chemical_data[,c(1,3,6)])
head(chemical_demographic_df)
```

Now that we have one dataframe with both gestational age and cadmium data we can easily filter using the next few lines of code.

```{r}
chemical_demographic_df %>%
    # Filtering for mothers that gave birth to babies that were at least 35 weeks old
    # Filtering for mothers with at least 1.5 micrograms/L urinary cadmium levels
    filter(GA > 35 & UCd > 1.5) %>%
    # Arranging the dataframe from highest to lowest cadmium levels
    arrange(-DWCd)
```
